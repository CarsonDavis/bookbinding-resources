## Coverart
This folder contains the Affinity Design files and pdf exports for cutting in Silhouette Studio of the various books I have bound. 

Exports are created by hiding the book components of the final version artboard and exporting the remaining components as a pdf.

When cutting in Silhouette Studio, the pdfs should be imported as vector but <i>not</i> grouped. This will allow you to change the cut settings for the text vs the cover. In the send menu, you'll want to select the elements so that for text, the path is cut, but for art, the borders are cut.
